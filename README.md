Project Overview: 
 
The goal of this project is to analyze hospital readmissions and patient outcomes by 
combining two datasets: 
• Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset (readmissions data). 
• MIMIC-III Clinical Database (ICU data). 
This will allow us to investigate which clinical factors affect readmissions, explore the 
relationships between various patient-level data, and build models to predict patient 
outcomes based on combined datasets.

Deliverables: 
1. Merged and Cleaned Dataset: 
• A fully cleaned and merged dataset from the Diabetes 130-US hospitals 
dataset and MIMIC-III ICU dataset, prepared for analysis. 
2. Exploratory Analysis and Visualizations: 
• Summary statistics and visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots) 
showing key trends and relationships between variables such as ICU length 
of stay, number of lab procedures, medications, and readmissions. 
3. Analysis of Group Differences and Relationships: 
• A detailed analysis of how patient demographics, clinical features, and 
treatments are associated with different outcomes. This includes insights into 
patient groups with significantly different outcomes. 
4. Predictive Models: 
• A model to predict patient readmission based on the combined datasets, with 
metrics on the model's performance and a detailed analysis of important 
features. 
5. Segment Analysis: 
• A segmentation of patients based on clinical features, showing which groups 
are at higher risk for readmission or extended ICU stays. Recommendations 
based on patient segmentation will be provided. 
6. Deployment of Model: 
• A deployed predictive model for hospital readmissions, accessible via a web interface 
for healthcare professionals. 
• Documentation on how to use the interface, input patient data, and interpret the 
readmission predictions.
